    "- **Loaded the data**: Loaded the student data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- **Displayed the original records**: Printed the original student records to ensure the data was loaded correctly.\n",
    "- **Sorted the data**: Sorted the DataFrame by profession (ascending) and by score (descending) to organize students based on these attributes.\n",
    "- **Displayed the sorted data**: Printed the sorted student data to verify the organization of students by profession and score.\n",
    "- **Initialized the groups**: Decided to create three groups and set up empty lists for each one to store students.\n",
    "- **Distributed the students**: For each unique profession, filtered the students and distributed them evenly into the groups using a round-robin method to ensure balance.\n",
    "- **Calculated the averages**: Created a function to calculate the average score for each group to measure performance distribution.\n",
    "- **Calculated the standard deviation**: Computed the initial standard deviation of the group averages to assess the variation between groups.\n",
    "- **Check for standard deviation ≤ 2**: Added a check to skip the swapping process if the initial standard deviation was already ≤ 2.\n",
    "- **Displayed the initial distribution**: Printed the initial distribution of students in each group, including average scores and the standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Swapped students**: Defined a function to minimize the standard deviation by swapping students between groups:\n",
    "    - Identified the group with the highest average score and the group with the lowest average score.\n",
    "    - Swapped the highest-scoring student from the group with the highest average score with the lowest-scoring student from the group with the lowest average score, focusing on students with the same profession.\n",
    "- **Attempted improvement**: Called the swap function to check if the swap reduced the group averages' standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Displayed the updated distribution**: Printed the updated distribution of students in each group after the swap and the new standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Compared the results**: Showed both the initial and final standard deviations to analyze the improvement (if any).\n",
    "- **Try Catch Block**: Added try catch blocks to handle exceotion in file reading etc.\n",
